# Lambda Gloves

Lambda Gloves is a computer-vision-based musical glove system that enables expressive, hands-free parameter control in digital audio workstations (DAWs) such as FL Studio and Ableton Live. By tracking finger tips and hand movements via webcam, Lambda Gloves translates gestures into MIDI messages, allowing for fully customizable control—ideal for live performance, studio production, or accessibility.

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Losera/Lambda-Gloves.git
cd Lambda-Gloves

### 2. Install Dependencies

Lambda Gloves requires Python 3.8 or higher. It's recommended to use a virtual environment. Install the required packages with:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Connect Your MIDI Device

Plug in your MIDI device and ensure it's recognized by your operating system. You may need to install drivers or configure settings in your DAW.

### 4. Run the Application

To start hand tracking and MIDI control, run:

```sh
python scripts/main.py
```

For the GUI version, run:

```sh
python scripts/gui.py
```

### 5. Configure Your DAW

In your DAW, set up a new MIDI track and select the Lambda Gloves MIDI output as the input for that track. Enable monitoring to hear the effects of your hand gestures.

## Troubleshooting

- **Hand Tracking Not Working**: Ensure your webcam is connected and not being used by another application. Check the console for error messages.
- **MIDI Device Not Recognized**: Make sure the device is properly connected and powered on. Try restarting the application or your computer.
- **Installation Issues**: Double-check that you're using the correct version of Python and that all dependencies are installed. Consider using a virtual environment to avoid conflicts.
